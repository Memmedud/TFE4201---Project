Warning detected by hpeesofsim during netlist flattening.
    Touchstone file parser warning:
    Line - 4, Column - 7 : # is not at the start of the line

SP SP1[1] <MyLibrary2_lib:SP_NF_GainMatchK:schematic>   freq=(1 GHz->3 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Noise data in the Touchstone file `C:/Users/student/MyWorkspace2_wrk/data/AT310113C.s2p'
    does not cover the current value of `freq'. Therefore, if noise
    simulation is requested the data will be obtained by extrapolation.

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Nonphysical noise data in S_Port `SNP1.CMP1'.
    When NFmin is used, set Rn >= 5.642 to avoid negative noise sources.

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Negative noise source in S_Port `SNP1.CMP1' set to zero.
    Noise simulation results may not be correct due to bad data for NFmin, Rn and Sopt.
